## Deployment

https://robo-mvc-tech-blog.herokuapp.com/

## Description   
   
For this Tech Blog, we used the MVC pattern to allow users to create blogs and comment on other users blogs. Users can log in to view their own dashboards and created blogposts.    

## Usage   
   
Users can view the heroku deployment and view a list of created blogs. If they click on login or dashboard links, they will be directed to sign up for an account. Then the app takes the user to their dashboard so they can create, edit, or delete a post.  Once they are done, they simply need to click logout to end their session.   

## Installation   

Developers who clone this repository will need to create an .env file modeled after the .env.example file. They will need node.js and mysql to create a databse and then seed starter data. Once they run npm start, the user can then open up the app in their browser and explore the blogs functionality.  

## Future Development

This project was meant to have comment functionality for users to write comments on other blogposts.
